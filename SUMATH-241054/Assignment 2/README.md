#Assignment 2

Went through the paper 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401' and following along with 'https://medium.com/data-science/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2' on implementing RAG using LangChain. If the system can’t find useful info in the local text file, it’ll make an API call (as part of Assignment 1.1) and respond based on that.
